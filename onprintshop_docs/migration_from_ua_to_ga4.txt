Migration from UA to GA4
6 min
Overview & Purpose
Standard Universal Analytics (UA) properties will cease processing all new hits as of July 1, 2023. This will be in line with Google's strategy to retire UA and replace it with Google Analytics 4, a new-generation measurement solution (GA4).
Google is giving all UA users a way to migrate their standard UA properties, such as the configuration of the property, web stream, users, events, objectives, and audiences, to GA4 in advance of this. In the absence of your explicit refusal and intervention, this will happen automatically. (or opt-out).
Read along to learn how you can migrate your UA data to GA4.
