What is Reorder?
Reordering is when your customer requests the same products with the same configuration as fulfilled (supplied) earlier.
This module is important and can provide big benefits to your business. A seamless reorder process can support more positive customer relationships, and help existing customers do frictionless business with your brand. A reorder button will give a stronger focus on your existing customers and make your relationship stronger.
At OnPrintShop we offer various reorder features both at the front and Admin.
Reorder from Admin
For all the orders Admin can reorder from the orders listing page. The Reorder is available in the following instances:
List Orders
Archive Orders (completed orders)

Admin can select as many product(s) from the order and proceed with placing the order.
