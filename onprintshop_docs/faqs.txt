Overview
Your customers are bound to have a few questions about your product offerings, services, company, printing methodology, etc. While you may try to answer these through blog posts, web content, or other resources, it can be difficult for customers to find the exact answers they need. If it takes too long to find information, they may leave your website and look elsewhere. 
Purpose
Creating an FAQ page helps visitors quickly find answers in one central location, improving their experience and keeping them engaged with your site. 
Configuration
This interface allows you to 
create, categorize, and manage FAQs
 (Frequently Asked Questions) across your website. You can add FAQs based on products or categories, organize them by topic, and control where they appear on your storefront (like product pages or headers/footers). 
This helps improve customer support, reduces repetitive queries, and enhances user experience.
Add an FAQ
For adding a new FAQ, navigate to the 
Admin Panel --> Content Management --> FAQs --> Add 
button (Top Right Link).
