How to create a Kit?
A Kit is a set of articles used for a specific purpose. It can be a school kit, college kit, office kit, etc. This will help customers order bulk products instead of separate products. Kits have been major attractions for businesses and schools, as they contain a product pack. Kits are more informative and versatile. Thus, add Kits to your web store and explore 
how they are important
.
Instead of a separate entity, the Kit Product will now be considered a ready-to-buy Product. This will help the Admins manage the sort order of the product without any hassle. Along with this other database, handling benefits comes in handy.
