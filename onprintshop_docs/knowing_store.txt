Overview & Purpose
You can offer goods and services online with the help of an online storefront. Although online stores that sell directly to customers, or B2C, are the most prevalent form of an online marketplace that we are aware of, the B2b sector is also enormous and thriving.

Businesses that sell to other businesses have an online store called a B2B one.

If your business is expanding and you want to cover B2B clients as well, you are at the right place. With OnPrintShop's Store Management module, you can create a private store, especially for your B2B audience.
