Overview & Purpose
Imposition is one of the fundamental steps in the printing process. It consists of the arrangement of pages to be printed on the printer’s sheet. This helps in obtaining faster printing, simplifying binding, and reducing paper waste. If imposition did correct then it minimizes printing time by maximizing the number of pages per impression and reduces the cost of press time and materials.
