Overview
You may already know that Admin can add various blocks in the content of Dynamic Pages. Here, we will walk you through the steps to add a Price Calculator block on the CMS page for quick orders. 
This will help their customers analyze the prices of all the website products on a single page and place the order without navigating through the whole website to find their desired product.
Custom Price Calculator Block
The price calculator block looks something like shown in the below image:
﻿
The ‘
Get Started
’ button will request the customer to upload, browse or create a product design as defined in the Product Section.
Following the type of block added, the system will provide a product dropdown and display all the mentioned products in the block as defined in the CMS.
Configure Price Calculator Block
Below is the reference that how an Admin can include the Price Calculator Block for different products as per their business needs
All Products:
{% block_product_calculator|all %}
Mention the 
‘all’ 
keyword after the product_calculator block.

‘Send Estimated Cost’ sections
 (if these blocks are enabled for the main site) from the Custom Price Calculator.

If the sections are enabled and Admin wishes to disable them for the Custom Price Calculator for CMS page then, it can be achieved by adding
