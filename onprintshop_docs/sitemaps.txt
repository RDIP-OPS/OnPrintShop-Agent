Overview & Purpose
The sitemap is a structured listing of your website intended for web crawlers and spiders of Search Engines. Using sitemaps you can publish links to your website and define the dynamic pages. The sitemaps contain website URLs, thus making it easy for the crawlers to find your pages. Along with the URLs, the sitemap also contains information about when the link was last modified, the changing frequency of the URL, and its priority.
Generating XML Sitemap
Admin can anytime generate a Sitemap for their website from the 
Admin >> SEO >> Sitemap >> XML Sitemap:
﻿
From the Edit tab, you can edit the generated XML Site map using the ‘View and Edit’ link. If you already have an XML created for your website, upload it using the ‘Upload File’ tab.
﻿
XML Settings
The XML files contain URLs along with their details such as – last modified, changing frequency, and priority. Using the XML Settings you can set a page’s priority, changing frequency, and last modified date.
﻿
There are 4 types of pages available namely – Home, Product, Content, and Other Pages.
Priority
 – This determines the priority of a particular URL compared to the other URLs on the site. This suggests webmasters crawl which pages are considered more important. The valid range is 0.0 to 1.0, where 1.0 is the most important. Priority does not affect the search listing, as it only suggests to the crawler how important the page is on the site.
Change Frequency
 - This defines how frequently a page may change. ‘Always’ denotes that the URL is changed every time it is accessed. “Never” is used to denote the archived URLs on the website.
Once you change any setting of these pages, it is advisable to again generate the XML File. This will update the changes made in the settings section.
One should also regularly submit an updated sitemap when new pages are published. This may allow search engines to find and index those pages more quickly than they would by finding the pages on their own.
