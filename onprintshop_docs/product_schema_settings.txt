Order and Impose Flow – Admin Panel
Once you assign a schema to a product or the ordered product is sheet-based, then you will have to impose the job on the sheet assigned. To do the same follow the steps below –
Assign a schema to products from 
Admin >> Imposition Beta >> Product Schema Settings.
Once you receive an order of the schema-assigned products.
Go to 
Admin >> List Orders
.
﻿
Under the Action menu of the order, you’ll find the ‘
Impose Order
’ option.
This will redirect you to the Impose Order screen.
﻿
If the customer has created/uploaded the design, then you get the option to download the user file or re-upload the print-ready file.
The schema selected in the Product Schema Setting will come pre-selected in this section. However, you can change the schema or continue.
Clicking on ‘
Impose Now
’ will allow you to download the print-ready imposed file.
