Overview & Purpose
Quote (quotation) is a fixed price offer, made by the Merchant (in our case it is a Print Service Provider) that can’t be changed once accepted by the customer. This holds true even if you have to carry out much more work than you expected.
After receiving the quote request, you can easily perform actions on the quote and even assign it to the printers, etc., all from the Admin Panel. You can also set an expiry date for the quote, this means the quote will no longer be valid after a defined time.
