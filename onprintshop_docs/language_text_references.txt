Overview
This interface allows you to manage the text for labels, buttons, and fixed sections across your storefront. The 
Search Textline
 feature includes a dropdown list of all available modules, enabling you to select the module for which you want to update the text. You can also use the 
Keyword Search
 to quickly find specific text entries.
Purpose
The purpose of this tool is to provide flexibility in customizing language and text references for different stores. By selecting a store from the dropdown, you can modify and save store-specific text, ensuring a tailored experience for each storefront.
Configuration
This guide will help you manage and customize text for labels, buttons, and fixed sections across different modules and stores in your OnPrintShop storefront. 
Edit Language Text References:
From the interface, you can edit or delete the language text reference changes made by you. Deleting a change will revert the text back to its default version on the storefront. Store customers can also perform these actions from their own admin panel.
Text lines are pre-configured in English. For multiple enabled languages, you must manually enter the translated text for each language.
