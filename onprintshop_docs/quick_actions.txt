﻿
This section will help you keep track of the activities performed on the quotes.

Convert to Order
﻿
You can directly convert Quote-to-Order(Offline) with/without it being Approved by your end-customers.
Example: You receive a Quotation Request via email, and its finalized over email itself. You might want to maintain this quotation in OnPrintShop.
This feature will benefit the Super Admin, Sub-Admin, and the Branch Admin.
This option will only be available for the quotes with status as 
‘Quotation’, ‘Quotation Approved’, ‘Quotation Partially completed’, 
and 
‘Quotation Completed’.
Clicking on the 
Convert to order 
button will display a pop-up with all the quote products. The products whose order has not been placed at least once will be ticked by default.
﻿
The 
Continue 
button will redirect you to the ‘Payment and Shipping’ page of the Offline Order. Here, you can enter the shipping and payment details and confirm the order.
On the offline order screen, you can also navigate to the second step, where you can change product options, price weight, and production days.
If the quote is yet to be approved and you convert the quote into order, then the order quantity selected will be considered as Approved (if there are multiple quantities for a quote product).
﻿
Duplicate Quote
﻿
You can easily create a duplicate of the original quote using the ‘Duplicate Quote’ option. Check the message that appears while creating a duplicate of the quote.
﻿
﻿
Delete
﻿
Delete any quotation with a 2-step confirmation. Quotes with the status of ‘Quotation Approved’ cannot be deleted.
Note:
 It is recommended that you take only one action at a time when some response is pending from the customer so as to avoid any chances of overlapping actions. For example, if you have entered your quote amount on the customer's quote, you should not use 'Post Message to Customer' unless your quotation is approved or rejected by the customer. If you use 'Post Message to Customer' in this scenario, it makes your previous quotation void and you will have to enter the quotation again for the customer to approve or reject it.
