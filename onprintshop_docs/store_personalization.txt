Overview

Using our customization features, you can create layouts for specific products or product groups. The system includes pre-built layouts for product pages, which you can preview using the preview icon. While these pre-built layouts cannot be edited, they can be assigned to your products.
Purpose

The purpose of this feature is to provide flexibility in presenting your products by allowing layout customization. Web and Mobile layouts for each Product Type are available under the Product Type tab, each with unique naming conventions to help you easily identify and assign the appropriate design.
Note:
 Any changes made in this section will directly be reflected on the Product Pages of your website.
