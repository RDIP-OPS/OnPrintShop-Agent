The priority of Rules assignment is defined as follows –
Product + Size + Quantity + Options
Product + Size + Quantity

When a product is assigned to multiple printers, then the product will be assigned to printers that satisfy maximum conditions. The printer satisfying maximum condition can be said to have ‘High Probability rate of Product Assignment’.
