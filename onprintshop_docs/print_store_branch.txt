Overview & Purpose
Print Store Branch generally refers to one of the many locations from where the store owner may be allowed to take direct orders with an intention to expand their printing business, whether through online or offline mode. The main office handles the administration of your company, while the branch locations operate the business.
Configuration
This section enlists all the branches created of your online store.
﻿
With this section Admin can manage the division of roles between the branches, eliminate redundant tasks, and improve efficiency with centralized strategy.
On the Print Store Branch dashboard, you get to manage details of every print store branch. Other than these you can also find a quick link to login as a branch to view their admin panel. You can toggle Print Store Branch status as Green (Active) or Red (Inactive).

Add Print Store Branch
To add a print store branch, navigate to the
 Admin >> Partners >> Print Store Branch >> +Add Button
