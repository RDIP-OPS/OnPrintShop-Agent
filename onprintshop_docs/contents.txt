Overview
Content pages provide general information about your business or products. At OnPrintShop, these content pages are categorized into two types:
Dynamic Pages
 – Displayed at the storefront with links and contain HTML content. Any content page added by the Admin is considered dynamic. The default dynamic pages cannot be deleted. You can toggle their status as Green (Active) or Red (Inactive) and preview them using the provided link.
Static Pages
 – Used in blocks within the inner pages of the storefront. These pages cannot be deleted, but you can toggle their status as Active or Inactive.
Additionally, you can create 
Page Categories
 to organize your content pages effectively.
Purpose
The purpose of content pages is to share important business or product information with your customers. These pages help structure and display relevant content throughout your storefront — in the Content section, sidebars, or footer — enhancing user experience and site navigation.

Marketing Landing Pages
﻿
Landing pages are designed to drive user action through a clear and focused 
Call to Action (CTA)
. They encourage engagement and help increase conversion rates while reducing the cost of acquiring leads or sales. To support your marketing efforts, we’ve created ready-to-use landing pages that can easily be integrated into your marketing funnel.
Each landing page includes the following built-in components:
A 
Dynamic Inquiry Form
 to capture user information.
Contact Us acknowledgment emails
 are sent to both the Admin and the customer.
A dedicated 
landing page for the inquiry form
.
Customizable source code
 that allows the Admin to set redirection links if needed.
An optional 
Dynamic Price Calculator Block
 for real-time pricing display.
These pages are 
disabled by default
. Contact the technical team to enable them and customize the inquiry form fields. 
Success Landing Pages
To create a success page:
Use the same name as the main landing page + 
_success
Example: 
marketing_landing_style_one_success
Add your custom success message or redirect instructions.

Admin has to write the page contents of the Contact Us Success landing pages or they can contact the technical team for the same

Creating a Content Page Category 
In addition to creating content pages, you can also organize them by creating 
Page Categories
. This helps in grouping similar pages for better management and navigation.

Admin Panel --> Content Management --> Contents --> Page Category
 tab
.
The process is similar to creating a content page. You can also:
