{"text": "We've improved the file download experience on the Modify Order page by renaming \"Download Original File\" to \""}
{"text": "Download Design Files"}
{"text": "\" for all products. When identical files are used across pages, only one download link will appear instead of separate links.

{"text": "\ufeff"}
{"text": "PDF Block:"}

{"text": "Template Layout:"}
{"text": "According to your business needs, you can create different layouts for a Product Page. For example, a 4-page brochure can offer a different set of designs for each page, giving the customer the freedom to choose a more customized layout for their product page."}
{"text": "While creating a Template Layout, you get a \u2018Page Name\u2019 dropdown, this will help you bind a product page with the design."}
